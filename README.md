## brief
a simple full-stack web development project using (html,css,js,nodejs) using openweathermap api
and a simple nodejs server that handles some basic routes with help of Express library and cors

## How to use it 
open your terminal and simply type : npm run start

## How it was useful for me
understanding Async functions was a bit tricky for me ... now i can use it easly without worries

the fun part of the project is using just vanillajs
